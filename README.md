# Cloud Posture Overview Dashboard – Product Management 

**Summary**  
- This project presents a Cloud Security Posture Management dashboard.  
- It shows how Product Managers and engineering teams can identify risks, prioritize findings, and track remediation progress.  
- The workflow moves from Overview (posture trends) → List (specific misconfigurations) → Details (resolution and compliance).  
- Screenshots and prototype links are included for clarity.

**Problem Statement**  
Cloud environments often face misconfigurations such as open storage buckets, weak access rules, or missing encryption.  
These issues create risks of data breaches and compliance failures.  
Teams struggle because findings are scattered, ownership is unclear, and progress is hard to measure.  
The dashboard provides one clear view to help Product Managers and engineers prioritize and resolve issues faster.

**Overview (Short)**  
- Total Findings: 275 (12% increase)  
- Critical & High Findings: 29 (8% decrease)  
- Accounts Affected: 47 (no change)  
- Mean Time to Remediate: 4.2 days (18% faster)  
- Quick filters by severity and provider (AWS, Azure, GCP)  
- Drill‑down into misconfigurations list and detailed finding view with assignment, remediation, and compliance tabs
